<p style="color:orange;">This is just for practice</p> 

<p>Yes i got it, i was trying it from so how much time.</p>  

<p title="My name is Avdhoot">Please put your mouse on me</br> this was very easy, I did this at first time.</p>

<h2>Single or Double Quotes?</h2>
<p>In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:</p>
<p>Move your mouse over the paragraphs below to see the effect:</p>

<p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>John with double quotes</p>
<p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson">John with single quotes</p>

<p>this had copied for the HTML 'Try It Yourself' because i wasn't getting it.</p>

<P>And now i ve started with the HTML Styles</p>
<P>from now i m gonna mention that for what is this thing used for in HTML and yes it can be anywhere in my text.</P>

<P>So,The HTML style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.</P>

<p>I am normal</p>
<p style="color:red;">I am red</p>
<p style="color:blue;">I am blue</p>
<p style="font-size:60px;">I am big</p>

<P style="color:purple;">Yap man, that was easy</P>

<P>And yes this word 'I am big' is not any heading, this i ve did with the style atribute</P>

<h2 style="color:blue;"s>STUDY TIME </h2>

<h2>The HTML Style Attribute</h2>
<P>etting the style of an HTML element, can be done with the style attribute.

The HTML style attribute has the following syntax:

<h2 style="color:blue;">STUDY TIME </h2>
<h2>Background Color</h2>
<P>The CSS background-color property defines the background color for an HTML element</P

<P>By the way i was had litraly forgotten that today is <style=font-bold>DIWALI</br>HAPPY DIWALI to all of you guys and today is laxmi pujan mean we have to lit firecrackers today it will be so fun. </P>

<h1 style="background-color:red;">Avdhoot</h1>

<h2 style="color:blue;">STUDY TIME </h2>

<h2>Text Color</h2>
<P>The CSS color property defines the text color for an HTML element</P>

<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">This is a heading</h1>

<h2 style="color:blue;">STUDY TIME </h2>
